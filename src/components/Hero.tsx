            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            I'm a passionate aspiring UI/UX designer with a strong interest in creating clean, 
            user-friendly digital experiences. I specialize in using Figma to design intuitive 
            interfaces and am currently building my skills in UX research, responsive design, 
            and interaction prototyping.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            My approach focuses on understanding real user needs and solving problems through simple, 
            thoughtful design. Iâ€™m eager to grow by working on real projects, collaborating with teams, 
            and continuously improving through feedback and practice.
